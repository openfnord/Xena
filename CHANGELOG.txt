Xena 6.0.0
==========

Feature Enhancements (Major)
----------------------------
* Addition of "Convert" functionality that will just perform conversion of input files (instead of also base64 encoding them and wrapping them in metadata as a xena file).  Note that unconverted files are copied to the output directory with a warning. (rfe-3386455)
* Xena now supports warning message output in the Message column (there are currently only warning messages for Convert functionality).  The Message column now shows an error (red cross) or warning (orange triangle with !) icon to show the type of message.  Other warning messages in Xena now use a corresponding orange triangle with ! icon (rfe-3308200)
* Addition of tika generated metadata to xena output as core functionality (rfe-3386465)
* Addition of Metadata plugin to allow additional metadata output to xena files as generated by exiftool (rfe-3386471)
* Addition of checksums for plugins: Audio, Plain Text, CSV, Image, SVG, Office, PDF, and also for DOM based files (rfe-3404143)

Feature Enhancements (Minor)
----------------------------
* Licensing updated from GPLv2 or higher to GPLv3 or higher
* Removed psd, basic, dataset and postscript plugins (rfe-3384086)
* Updated xom.nu libraries used to version 1.2.6
* Image plugin now adds the use of Image Magick libraries (in particular this has better results for tiff files and animated gif files)
* Updated and moved spreadsheets of external libraries used
* Export functionality now renames files with a number suffix (before the file extension) if a file of the name it would normally export to exists
* Xena Viewer Export functionality now warns when trying to output to a non-existent directory instead of creating that directory (which brings the functionality in line with the Export functionality from the main Xena interface)
* Fixed the default log location in Xena (rfe-3221583)
* Support added for altering level of log output using the loglevel parameter in the preferences file (rfe-3404153)
* Full stack traces are now given on exception (rfe-3396056)
* The "Binary Normalise Failures" button is now only shown when Normalising, not when Binary Normalising (or when Converting) unless Binary Normalising by pressing the button. (rfe-3404148)
* The About Plugins dialog (under help) is now sized more appropriately based on the number of plugins present (rfe-3404146)
* Plugin build numbers are no longer displayed in the about plugins dialog (rfe-3385976)
* Added build instructions to README in base directory of Xena
* Added .txt suffix to many files in tech_docs directories
* Renamed PNGGuesser.java to PngGuesser.java
* Cleanup of source code and source code comments in various areas

Bug Fixes
---------
* Office file normalisation now puts in correct product name and version used for conversion in the description (bug-3301419)
* Added handling of xbm files to the image plugin (X11 only; not X10) (bug-2904265)
* Fixed an issue where Xena would hang when attempting to normalise certain tiff files under Windows (bug-2910397)
* Output files are now deleted on error (unless there are multiple output files in which case only one is deleted, which is a known bug: bug-3400488) (bug-2910376)
* Updated guessing to check full magic number length rather than only the first 4 bytes (bug-3386534)
* Moved core functionality that was in the NAA plugin to actual core classes (particularly the default wrapper) (bug-3156618)
* Fixed error when no exported digest is produced that resulted in the error "null" (with stack trace) (bug-3155089)
* Fixed error with new lines when normalising tsv or csv files that resulted in export functionality not working correctly (bug-3095399)
* Notice now given to user if file deletion fails when normalisation/migration cancelled (bug-3379425)

Note that bug fixes and additions that relate to a feature listed that was not present in Xena 5.0.0 are not shown in this list (e.g. numerous bug fixes related to the addition of the "Convert" functionality)
