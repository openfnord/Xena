<section name="How To: Read project data from a file">

<p>There are two ways to read project data from a file: you can use a class 
provided by MPXJ which will select the correct Reader to open the file
for you, or you can use a Reader class directly.</p>

<p>The example below illustrates how MPXJ can select the correct Reader class
for you. The example assumes that you have provided the file name in the
inputFile variable.</p>

<source>
import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile;
import net.sf.mpxj.reader.ProjectReader;
import net.sf.mpxj.reader.ProjectReaderUtility;

...

ProjectReader reader = ProjectReaderUtility.getProjectReader(inputFile);
ProjectFile projectFile = reader.read(inputFile);
</source>

<p>The second approach is to use one of the Reader classes directly if you know
which type of project you are dealing with. This is shown by the example below.</p>
</section>

<source>
import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile;
import net.sf.mpxj.mpp.MPPReader;

...

MPPReader reader = new MPPReader();
ProjectFile projectFile = reader.read(inputFile);
</source>
