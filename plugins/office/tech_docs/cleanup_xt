The xt library source is currently taking up 11MB, we only need the source which takes up about 2-3MB so we need to clean up the structure a bit.

Luckily we don't build the xt source, because it doesn't compile correctly using a later version of Java, so we don't have to worry about killing the build script by removed the required build libraries. 

To free up some space we remove:
	doc/
	ant/lib
	lib/
	thirdparty/
