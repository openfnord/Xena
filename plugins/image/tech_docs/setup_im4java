im4java (Image Magick for Java) is a library which wraps the image magick command line tools. 

The use of this library is _hopefully_ only temporary until the sanselan library can support the CCITT compression algorithms inside Tiffs, when that happens the image plugin will be back as pure java plugin.

We have had to modify the code slightly, by default the library just tries to call the commands from the command line, so the binaries have to been on the system path.. as we want to ship the binary and use it from a relative location (optionally) we need to set the command the library has to use itself. 
The library has a setCommand method, but when you use it, it appends the new command to the end of a linked list object, meaning you aren't actually replacing the command at all. I assume this is a bug, but may be required to string commands together, so rather then replacing the command, I created a new method clearCommand which will clear the linked list. I have created a patch and submitted it back to the developers, so hopefully it'll be implemented one day. The patch is simply:

<code>

As we only need the source code and don't want to store any of the extra "cruft" in our repository we remove the following from the source folder:
	images.src/
	bin/
	input/

The source code doesn't come with a ant build script so we had to create our own. It is attached to the end of this document.
