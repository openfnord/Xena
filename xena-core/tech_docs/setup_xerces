We use the third party xerces library in XENA, which we compile from source at build time, but unfortunately the plain extracted size of the xerces source is 18MB!
So this howto explains what we've done to the source to trim the size down a little.. We don't remove actual source code, only unneeded docs and test data.

We remove:
	docs/

The other main directories taking up space are tools and src.
Tools is needed by the build script so cannot be removed.
The src directory, contains the source which cannot be removed.. Sometimes the test and test data exist in the src directory, but not in this case.

It leaves xerces still a large 17MB, but it is the best we can do at the moment.
