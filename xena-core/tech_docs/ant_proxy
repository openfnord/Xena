At the National Arcives we need to use ntlmaps to access the internet.

Although simply exporting http_proxy allows us access via the command line, this doesn't work for ant.

In ant you can specufy a proxy using: <setproxy ../>
This isn't good when all our stuff it distributed over the internet... this would lead to proxy errors on user machines.

If you find yourself needing internet access through ant and behind a proxy then you can use:
  export ANT_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=localhost -Dhttp.proxyPort=5865 -Dhttps.proxyHost=localhost -Dhttps.proxyPort=5865"

Obviously change "localhost" and the port to what ever yours is set to. And notice it's setting http and https.
