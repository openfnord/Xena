This is the first cut at a workspace for the Indexer used in JavaHelp 1.0.
Pretty soon we will migrate the JavaHelp workspace so we just import some
JAR files from here.

lib/
 -- the next 3 files are used internally and in JavaHelp --
   jsearch-misc.jar
	this JAR file contains the javax.javahelp.search API classes
	as well as other files that are needed to run the jhindexer
	& jhsearch standalone.  Right now just HeaderParser.
   jsearch-client.jar
	The client-side classes needed to do searches (jhsearch)
   jsearch-indexer.jar
	The indexer classes (jhindexer)

lib/
 -- this is the deliverable to the end-user --
   jsearch.jar
	anything (but swing.jar) needed to do searches and to create
	the search database.
	== jsearch-client.jar + jsearch-indexer.jar + jsearch-misc.jar

src/
   client/
     the sources for the client side of the search engine
   indexer/
     the sources for the indexer.

Examples:

demos/holidays - this is the holidays example from the JavaHelp distribution.

% cd demos/holidays
% mkdir ../FooIndex
% /bin/rm -rf ../FooIndex/*
% ../../jhindexer -db ../FooIndex -verbose `find . -name '*.html' -print`
% ../../jhsearch ../FooIndex
holidays
christmas
