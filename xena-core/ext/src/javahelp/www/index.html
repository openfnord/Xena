The JavaHelp system is an online help system that developers can use
to add online help to their Java platform applications. The JavaHelp
system is both a JCP specification (<A
HREF="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=97">JSR 97</A>) and a
reference implementation of that specification. The JavaHelp system
open source project includes the source to the reference implementation.

<h3>Overview </h3>
<!--END SECTION HEADER *  THIS IS A GREEN BAR WITH WHITE TEXT   -->
<p>
The JavaHelp system provides developers and authors with a standard,
fully featured, easy to use system for presenting online information
to Java application users.  The JavaHelp system is a
Java Platform, Standard Edition ("Java SE") optional package.
</p>
<p>
The JavaHelp system consists of a fully featured, extensible
specification and API, and a reference implementation of that
specification and API that is written entirely in the Java programming language.
The JavaHelp system reference implementation, based on the Java Foundation
Classes (JFC, also known as Swing), provides a standard interface that
enables both application developers and authors to add online help to
their applications.
</p>
<p>
The specification and API enable developers to customize and extend the help system to fit the style
and requirements of their applications.
</p>
<p>
The JavaHelp system has been designed to work especially well in a variety of network
environments. The JavaHelp system is platform independent and works in all browsers that support the Java
platform.
</p>
<p>
The JavaHelp system enables Java developers to provide online help for:
<ul>
<li>Applications (both applet and standalone)
<li>JavaBeans components
<li>Applets in HTML pages
<li>Server-based Java applications 
</ul>

<li>A description of the contents of the current JavaHelp system release.
<li>A general overview of the JavaHelp system. Describes features, usage scenarios, and other technical details.
<li>A guide for help authors. Describes how to: set up a help system, use popups and secondary windows, use
context-sensitive help, use full-text search, and package help information for delivery to users.
<li>A guide for developers. Describes how to: add JavaHelp to applications, implement context-sensitive help,
embed JavaHelp components into applications, and develop lightweight Java components that can be added
to help topics.

<h3>Build the JavaHelp System</h3>
<!--END SECTION HEADER *  THIS IS A GREEN BAR WITH WHITE TEXT   -->
<p>
The easiest way to build the JavaHelp system is to open the three
NetBeans projects that make up the JavaHelp system sources in the <a
href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans IDE</a>. You can also build it
using the Ant build script (<code>build.xml</code>) located in the
project's <code>javahelp_nbproject/</code> directory.  Note that the
build downloads the JDIC, JSP, and Servlet APIs that are required for
compilation.
</p>
<p>
The project also has GNU Make makefiles that can build the project on
the Solaris operating system.  In order to use the makefiles, you must
download and install the <A
HREF="https://glassfish.dev.java.net">Glassfish</A> and <A
HREF="https://jdic.dev.java.net">JDIC</A> builds and set the J2EEHOME and
JDICHOME environment variables to the top-level directories of each. 
The makefiles are adaptable to the Linux operating system.
</p>
<p>
The primary method for building the project is using GNU Make, the Ant scripts are provided
solely for your convenience.  The demos included with the release can only be built
using the makefiles and are not built during the Ant build. 
</p>

<h3>The JavaHelp Version 2.0 Technical Compatibility Kit (TCK)</h3>
<!--END SECTION HEADER *  THIS IS A GREEN BAR WITH WHITE TEXT   -->
<p>
Because the JavaHelp system is a Java SE platform optional package,
any implementation of the specification must pass the TCK in order
to verify its compatibility with the JSR 97 specification.
</p>
<p>
The TCK is packaged as a Zip archive. After you download and unpack the Zip
archive, you must edit and modify the five properties at the top of the
file <code>run-test.xml</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that execution of the compatibility kit requires Ant. Ant is available at
<A href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/ </A>.
<p>
To run the tests execute the following command:
<p>
<code><b>ant -f run-test.xml</b></code>
