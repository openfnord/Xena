<h1>Glossary</h1>
<hr />

<p>The following table provides a list of definitions for some of the terms used in the Xena Help topics.</p>

<br />
<table>
<tr><th>Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr>

<tr><td><i>AIP (Archival Information Package)</i></td><td>
Normalised record that is stored in the digital repository with accompanying preservation metadata.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>ASCII</i></td><td>
A code for representing English characters as numbers, with each letter assigned a number from 0 to 127. For example, the ASCII code for upper-case M is 77. Most computers use ASCII codes to represent text, which makes it possible to transfer data from one computer to another.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Base64 Encoding</i></td><td>
A method of representing binary data as text.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Binary AIP</i></td><td>
A binary normalised record that is stored in the digital repository with accompanying preservation metadata.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Binary Normalising</i></td><td>
The process of converting the original data object to Base64 encoding.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Binary Object</i></td><td>
An object that is stored in a computer, formatted as a sequence of zeros and ones.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Bitmap Graphics</i></td><td>
A raster image format stored as values representing coloured pixels that make up an image.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Closed Format</i></td><td>
A file format that is owned by an entity and for which the specification is not publically available. In a preservation sense, it is not wise to store data in these formats as they are not able to be freely utilised.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Convert</i></td><td>
Conversion of an input file to an openly-specified file format. This process does not involve creation of a Xena file.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Data Object</i></td><td>
The smallest discrete unit of digital records for preservation.  In desktop computing terms, a file.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Digital Preservation</i></td><td>
The act of preserving digital information, usually computer files such as documents and images.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Digital Record</i></td><td>
A record for which access depends on the use of a computer system.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Embedded Metadata</i></td><td>
Metadata included within a data file.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Export</i></td><td>
The process of separating content and metadata in a normalised file in order to represent the content in an accessible manner.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)</i></td><td>
An open format for audio files that offers excellent audio quality and lossless compression.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Format</i></td><td>
A structured means of storing digital information such that it can be interpreted by a software application.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Metadata</i></td><td>
Information used to manage, use and understand data - literally 'data about data'. An example for a photograph (stored as a digital image) might be the date and time that the image was captured or the shutter speed and aperture of the camera used.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Metadata Wrapper / Package Wrapper</i></td><td>
A component of Xena that wraps a small amount of metadata in each preserved AIP. 
The metadata includes information about the file including date last modified, date normalised, date created, normaliser version.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Normaliser</i></td><td>
Xena Plugin used to convert a source data format into equivalent open format.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Normalising</i></td><td>
The process of converting records from their original formats into open, preservation formats.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Open Format</i></td><td>
A data format which is not encumbered by patents and for which the specification is publicly available. These formats are good for preserving data as they are able to be freely utilised.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>ODF (Open Document Format)</i></td><td>
An ISO approved open format for storing documents, such as spreadsheets and presentations.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>PNG (Portable Network Graphics)</i></td><td>
An open format for raster images.</td></tr>

<!-- <tr><td><i>Preservation</i></td><td>
Operational term for the second stage in digital preservation process where normalising and binary wrapping of data object occurs.</td></tr> -->

<tr><td><i>Preservation Format</i></td><td>
A standardised format for the storage of data objects.</td></tr>

<!-- <tr><td><i>Quarantine</i></td><td>
Operational term for the first stage in digital preservation process where checking for content accuracy and virus occurs.</td></tr> -->

<tr><td><i>Raster Graphics</i></td><td>
Raster is a way to represent an image through individually coloured picture elements (pixels) and the placement of these pixels creates the overall image. Quality is lost when zooming as it is simply a magnification of the pixels.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Vector Graphics</i></td><td>
A digital image encoded as mathematical formulas that represent lines, shapes and curves. Vector images may be zoomed with no loss of quality.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Xena File</i></td><td>
This is a resulting normalised file. It contains the original data converted to an open format with XML metadata.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Xena Viewer</i></td><td>
Component of Xena that displays a normalised file in various formats, such as its normalised version, the raw data and the XML as well as any wrapped metadata.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</i></td><td>A way to store structured information in a flat file via the use of tags.</td></tr>
