XOM
----
XOM handles XML processing. Due to licensing issues it has replaced JDOM.
Changes were required to be made to XOM source code in order for it to work properly with Xena.
These changes are:

* In the Builder class make the build(InputSource) method a public
method.

* Made the XOMHandler class a public class. 

* Because XOMHandler is used for XML snippets, startDocument may not be
called. Thus move the initialisation for the document, current,
parent and parents fields from the startDocument method to the
constructor.

JAXEN
------
the Jaxen source has references to the JDOM, DOM4J and XOM projects. 
To build it from source, delete the packages referring to JDOM and DOM4J.
