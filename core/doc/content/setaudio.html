<h1>Audio</h1>
<hr />

<p>The external tool used by Xena to convert audio files is <b>FLAC</b> (Free Lossless Audio Codec).</p>

<p>During compression, FLAC does not lose quality from the audio
stream, unlike lossy compression formats such as MP3 and AAC.</p>

<ul>
<li>FLAC (<em>http://flac.sourceforge.net</em>) is a free and open source software tool and file format for lossless audio data compression.</li>
</ul>

<br />

<h2>Location of external program</h2>
<p>Depending on your operating system, the FLAC executable may be included with the
Xena package. If so, the executable will be located within a sub-directory of the directory containing the 
Xena program (<strong>xena.jar</strong>). Otherwise, the executable must be installed separately. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Linux - install <b>flac</b> via your
    distribution's package manager. After installation, the flac executable
    is most likely located under <i>/usr/bin/</i>.
  <li>OS X - the file is called <b>flac</b> and is located in the <b>macx86</b> sub-directory.</li>
  <li>Windows - the file is called <b>flac.exe</b> and is located in the
    <b>winx86</b> sub-directory.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<br />

<h2>How to configure the Audio plugin</h2>
<ol>
  <li>From the Xena menu bar, select <b>Tools - Plugin Preferences - Audio</b>: 
    <p><img src="../images/04-prefs-menu-audio.png"
    alt="Plugin preferences - audio" /></p>
    <br />

    <p><b>Result:</b> The audio properties window is displayed.</p>
    <p><img src="../images/07-prefs-audio.png" alt="Audio properties window"
    /></p>
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Click <b>Browse</b> and navigate to the location of the FLAC
  executable (see above).</li>
  <li>Click <b>Open</b>.</li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b> to save the setting.
<p><b>Result:</b> Xena will now be able to convert audio into FLAC.
</li>
</ol>
