<h1>Viewing options</h1>
<hr />

<p>There are several options available when viewing Xena files. Whilst viewing a preserved file in Xena Viewer, use the drop-down menu at the top of the window to switch between available views.</p>
<p>The default view is the Xena Package View, which represents the original data on screen.</p>

<h2>Xena Package View</h2>
<p>Depending on the format of the file you are viewing, you should see the original file contents displayed in this view. 
If not, there may be further viewing options. 
For example, the viewer won't display Microsoft Office files but will offer the option to open the file in the OpenOffice.org suite.</p>

<p>The following shows an image being viewed via the <em>Xena Package View</em>.</p>

<h2>Raw XML View</h2>
<p>To see the file in its XML format, select <em>Raw XML View</em>.</p>
<p>The following image shows a TIFF file in Raw XML View. The TIFF metadata has been preserved during the conversion of the file to PNG format.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Large files may be split into multiple chunks. To see all of the XML, use the navigation buttons to browse through the pages. </p>

<h2>XML Tree View</h2>
<p>The <em>XML Tree View</em> displays the XML metadata according to the XML hierarchy of the Xena file.</p>
