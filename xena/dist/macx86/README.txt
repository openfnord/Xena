The provided executables are not suitable for all Apple Macintosh distributions and may result in errors.  It may be required to download and install these programs separately.

Please note that the "convert" executable is part of the ImageMagick product.  The particular "convert" executable included here is intended for a 64 bit Macintosh running the Darwin 11.0.0 kernel.  For older distributions it may prove necessary to build the executable as described on the homepage of Image Magick (www.imagemagick.org).  Note that this process requires the installation of XCode and of MacPorts.  Many users may find it worth trying the installation provided by CactusLab under www.cactuslab.com/imagemagick/ fist as this is much easier to install and does not require the installation of XCode or MacPorts (although this installation is for a slightly older version of Image Magick).
