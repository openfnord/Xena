The provided executables and binary packages are not suitable for all Apple Macintosh distributions and may result in errors.  It may be required to download and install these programs separately.

Please note that the provided ImageMagick-x86_64-apple-darwin11.1.0.tar.gz will need to be extracted prior to use.  This binary package is for a 64 bit Machintosh running the Darwin 11.1.0 kernel.  If your Machintosh is not 64 bit or using the Darwin 11.1.0 kernel then you will need to download and install Image Magick separately from the Image Magick homepage (www.imagemagick.org).  For older distributions it may prove necessary to build the executable from source, a process which requires the installation of XCode and MacPorts.  In this case you may find it worth trying the installation provided by CactusLab under www.cactuslab.com/imagemagick/ first as this is much easier to install and does not require the installation of XCode or MacPorts (although this installation is for a slightly older version of Image Magick - 6.6.5-10).

Note that Xena needs the location of the "convert" executable which is part of Image Magick and is located in the "bin" directory of the provided binary package (ImageMagick-x86_64-apple-darwin11.1.0.tar.gz).
