XT

An XSLT 1.0 processor written in Java.

XT attempts to be a fast, fully conformant XSLT 1.0 processor.

XT was originally written by James Clark.  Starting with version 
20020426, Bill Lindsey has been maintaining,  improving conformance 
to XSLT 1.0 recommendation, and adding TrAX APIs and EXSLT extensions.

XT binaries and source code are freely available with hope that
some may find it useful.  See the file "copying.txt" for the
license restrictions.

The latest version should be available at:
   http://www.blnz.com/xt

Additional documentation is in the file "index.html"

Any bugs have most likely been introduced by Bill Lindsey, and
are not the fault of the earlier author.
